# Movie App

Movie App is an app for listing the world's most popular movies at the moment.

## Description

MovieApp is using the MovieAPI "https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/movies/get-movie-details" for fetching the data and then rendering the movies as a paginated list. It is a Single Page Application made via using React with React Router v6.8.2. It was a challenge using the loader functions for fetching the data and I was not able to render the paginated list using said loader functions so I opted to using the useState and useEffect Hooks. This was a great learning experience and I hope to further develop my skills in the technologies used in this app.
